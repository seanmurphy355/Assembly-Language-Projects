# Assembly-Language-Project
This repository holds an example project using Assembly Language.

### Built With
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pl/) - IDE
* [Assembly Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language) - Low-level programming language
* [x86 MASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Macro_Assembler) - X86 MASM

## What is Assembly Language?
Assembly language is a low-level programing language that is utlized by specific types of processors. Code written in assembly language is converted into machine code by the assembler during runtime. Programming languages are classified into three categories 1.High level language(C,C++,Java), 2. Assembly language and 3. Machine language (binary digits or bits). The advantages of coding in a lower level language such as Assembly consist of faster speeds, performance manipulation, easy to correct errors, easy insertion or deletion, ability to access machine dependent registers and much more.

#### Basic Assembly Language Commands

-MOV - move data from one location to another
-ADD - add two values
-SUB - subtract a value from another value
-PUSH - push data onto a stack
-POP - pop data from a stack
-JMP - jump to another location


### Project Description
Implement and test of ReadVal and WriteVal procedures for none negative integers. ReadVal implementation will accept a numeric string input from the keyboard and will compute the corresponding integer value. For example, if the user entered a string "1234" then the numeric value 1234 would be computed (and stored in the requested OFFSET). WriteVal will perform the opposite transformation. For example, WriteVal can accept a 32 bit unsigned int and display the corresponding ASCII representation on the console (e.g. if WriteVal receives the value 49858 then the text "49858" will be displayed on the screen this value will no longer be read as an int).

## objectives
-Designing, implementing, and calling low-level I/O procedures
-Implementing and using a macro
